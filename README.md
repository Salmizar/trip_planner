# trip_planner

This App is designed to make trip planning with friends easier. Too often we have busy schedules and are unable to all decide in a timely fasion if we can make trips 
or inform others when they can no longer go.

The goal of this app is to make trip planning and viewing effortless. Anyone can jump on, see the trips, who's going, when arrive and departure days will be etc.

Long term, the intention is to have a weather tab that will display all of the information weather inforation for all of the area's we like to ride in. Saving us time
from viewing each indivigually. 

**Built with**
React.js. tailwind CSS, Utilizing GCP Firebase for Auth, firebase DB and firebase RTDB
Leverages OpenWeatherMaps API for weather data.
